      content : Hi Mike, just wanted to drop you a line regardinging the new Worcester boiler you recently installed at our house. Myself and Cath would like to thank you for your professionalism and knowledge in fitting the boiler explaining everything thoroughly as you went about your installation. The radiators and water have never been so hot, and we seem to be spending less money on our gas card. Kind regards, Andy & Cath

      content : Having initially been called out to rescue a couple of birds that were stuck behind our gas fireplace (which has now been decommissioned), Mike now regularly checks and services our boiler. We have found him to be honest, reliable and trustworthy, and priced fairly to boot! Very happy to recommend Mike to anyone that needs work doing.
